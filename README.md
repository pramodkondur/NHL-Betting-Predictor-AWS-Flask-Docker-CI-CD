### Introduction
The National Hockey League (NHL) stands as one of the most popular sports leagues in North America, with a passionate fanbase extending across the globe. The intense speed, strategy, and unpredictability of hockey make it a thrilling sport for both fans and bettors. With the legalization and rise of sports betting in various regions, wagering on NHL games has become an exciting way for fans to engage with the sport.

However, NHL betting poses unique challenges due to factors like team dynamics, player form, injuries, and home-ice advantage. These elements can make predicting game outcomes difficult. 

---

### Motivation for the Project
The motivation behind this project stems from the intersection of data science and sports betting. Sports bettors often rely on subjective opinions or surface-level statistics, which can lead to inconsistent results. This project aims to provide a more robust, data-driven approach to predicting NHL game outcomes.

The volatility of the NHL, influenced by a variety of in-game and external factors, makes traditional predictions challenging. Machine learning can help bettors navigate this complexity by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns that humans might overlook. By leveraging advanced analytics, bettors can improve their chances of making more informed and profitable wagers.

## 2. Data Preprocessing and Preparation
 This step contains various steps in order to utlize our data for our modelling. 
 They are as follows:

- Check for null values
- Remove duplicate values as we don't necessarily want all the events of a game such as shot, miss etc.
- Replacing team name discrepancies such as N.J, T.B etc. mentioned as well NJD, TBF etc.,as well as ATL which were relocated to winnepeg after 2011 and became Winnepeg Jets.

```
duplicate_mapping = {
    'S.J': 'SJS',   # San Jose Sharks
    'N.J': 'NJD',   # New Jersey Devils
    'T.B': 'TBL',   # Tampa Bay Lightning
    'L.A': 'LAK'    # Los Angeles Kings
}

# Replace duplicates in 'awayTeamCode' and 'homeTeamCode' columns
df['awayTeamCode'] = df['awayTeamCode'].replace(duplicate_mapping)
df['homeTeamCode'] = df['homeTeamCode'].replace(duplicate_mapping)
# Replace ATL
df['homeTeamCode'] = df['homeTeamCode'].replace('ATL', 'WPG')
df['awayTeamCode'] = df['awayTeamCode'].replace('ATL', 'WPG')
```

## 3. Adding various new features/columns:

In this step we create new features which would assist us while modelling.

We add features such as 

- 'total_games_played_by_home' - total number of games played by the home team so far

- 'total_games_played_by_away' - total number of games played by the away team so far

- 'total_wins_home' - total wins by the current home team so far

- 'total_losses_home' - total losses by the current home team so far 

- 'total_wins_away' - total wins by the current away team so far

- 'total_losses_away' - total losses by the current awawy team so far

```
# Sort the DataFrame by season and game_id
df = df.sort_values(by=['season', 'game_id']).reset_index(drop=True)

# Initialize columns for total games, wins, and losses
df['total_games_played_by_home'] = 0
df['total_games_played_by_away'] = 0
df['total_wins_home'] = 0
df['total_losses_home'] = 0
df['total_wins_away'] = 0
df['total_losses_away'] = 0

# Use dictionaries to store cumulative counts
team_games_count = {}
team_wins_count = {}

# Variable to keep track of the last season processed
last_season = None

# Iterate through each row to calculate totals
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    # Get team codes and season
    home_team = row['homeTeamCode']
    away_team = row['awayTeamCode']
    season = row['season']

    # Reset the dictionaries if the season has changed
    if last_season != season:
        team_games_count = {}
        team_wins_count = {}
        last_season = season

    # Initialize if not present for home team
    if home_team not in team_games_count:
        team_games_count[home_team] = {'total': 0, 'wins': 0}
    if away_team not in team_games_count:
        team_games_count[away_team] = {'total': 0, 'wins': 0}

    # Update current row with previous totals
    df.at[index, 'total_games_played_by_home'] = team_games_count[home_team]['total']
    df.at[index, 'total_games_played_by_away'] = team_games_count[away_team]['total']
    df.at[index, 'total_wins_home'] = team_wins_count.get(home_team, 0)
    df.at[index, 'total_losses_home'] = df.at[index, 'total_games_played_by_home'] - df.at[index, 'total_wins_home']
    df.at[index, 'total_wins_away'] = team_wins_count.get(away_team, 0)
    df.at[index, 'total_losses_away'] = df.at[index, 'total_games_played_by_away'] - df.at[index, 'total_wins_away']

    # Update counts for the home team
    team_games_count[home_team]['total'] += 1
    if row['homeTeamWon'] == 1:
        team_wins_count[home_team] = team_wins_count.get(home_team, 0) + 1

    # Update counts for the away team
    team_games_count[away_team]['total'] += 1
    if row['homeTeamWon'] == 0:
        team_wins_count[away_team] = team_wins_count.get(away_team, 0) + 1

```

- 'last_10_games_wins_home' - last 10 games win count for current home team

- 'last_10_games_wins_away' - last 10 games win count for current away team'


```

df['last_game_result_away'] = df.apply(lambda row: get_last_game_result(row['awayTeamCode'], row['game_id'], row['season']), axis=1)
```

All of these will be useful fo our prediction

## 4. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

In this we will try to look at an overall view of how the teams data looks

![img](static/images/graph1.png)
Noticebaly there is less score for SEA(Seattle Kraken) as they were only formed in 2021
![img](static/images/graph2.png)
![img](static/images/graph3.png)
![img](static/images/graph4.png)


Here are several conclusions that we can draw from our exploratory data analysis (EDA):

- Home vs. Away Performance:

There are notable variations in win probabilities between home and away games, suggesting that the venue of a match significantly impacts team performance. Teams tend to perform better at home, emphasizing the importance of incorporating features that distinguish between home and away games in predictive models.
Team Performance Disparities:

The total wins recorded across different teams reveal significant disparities in performance levels. Some teams consistently outperform others, indicating that certain franchises may have stronger rosters, better coaching strategies, or more effective training programs. This information could guide decisions related to team development and resource allocation.

- Win Progression Over Time:

The analysis of win progression over time shows distinct trends for each team throughout the seasons. Certain teams display sustained success, while others struggle to maintain consistency. This trend analysis can help identify patterns in performance, enabling teams to understand periods of strength and weakness and informing future strategic decisions.

- Insights into Team Dynamics:

By examining win statistics in relation to various factors (e.g., opponent strength, player injuries, or changes in coaching staff), we can derive deeper insights into the dynamics of each team. This understanding could inform decisions on player acquisitions, trades, or changes in coaching staff to enhance overall team performance.

- Fan Engagement and Marketing Strategies:

Understanding how different teams perform in various contexts can help franchises tailor their marketing strategies and fan engagement initiatives. For instance, highlighting a team’s strong home performance could drive ticket sales, while strategies could be developed to boost support during away games.

- Seasonal Trends:

Insights gained from analyzing performance trends across seasons can guide teams in assessing their long-term strategies. Recognizing when a team tends to perform best or struggles may assist in optimizing training schedules, scouting efforts, and overall resource management.

- Predictive Modeling Opportunities: (OUR MAIN FOCUS HERE)

The variations in team performance and the impact of game location present opportunities for developing predictive models that can forecast outcomes based on historical performance data. Incorporating factors such as home/away status, total wins, and win progression could improve the accuracy of predictions and aid in strategic planning.

Overall, these conclusions can help inform strategic decisions for team management, fan engagement, and predictive modeling while emphasizing the importance of continuous performance analysis in sports analytics.

## 5. Model Training, Testing and Evaluation

In this step, we will look to train,test, and evaluate our model. The dataset is split into train and test and evaluated first on a base Random Forest Model without all the new features and then further 3 models with the new features and the results are as so:
- A baseline model achieved an F1 score of **52%**, giving a basic measure of predictive performance.
- An enhanced model which was a fine tuned Random Forest model achieved an F1 score of **61%**, demonstrating significant improvement.


## 6. Flask Application

The project utilizes Flask to create a web application that enables users to interact with the predictive model seamlessly. Flask, being a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, is ideal for this project due to its simplicity and flexibility.

### Key Features of the Flask Application:
- **User Input**: Users can enter details such as team names and game data to receive predictions about game outcomes.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: The application processes user input in real-time, providing immediate feedback based on the trained machine learning model.
- **API Endpoints**: The Flask app exposes RESTful API endpoints that facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end components, allowing for easy integration and scalability.
- **Deployment Ready**: The application is designed to be easily deployable on cloud platforms like AWS, ensuring accessibility and scalability.

The Flask application serves as the interface for users to interact with the predictive model, making it an essential part of the overall architecture of the project.

## 7. Including Modular Approach

### Importance of Modular Coding in Machine Learning

A modular approach to coding involves breaking down a program into distinct, manageable components or modules, each of which handles a specific part of the functionality. This is particularly important in machine learning for several reasons:

- **Reusability**: Modules can be reused across different projects or different parts of the same project. This reduces redundancy and speeds up the development process.
- **Maintainability**: Modular code is easier to read, understand, and maintain. Changes or updates can be made to specific modules without affecting the entire codebase.
- **Collaboration**: In team environments, modular coding allows multiple developers to work on different components simultaneously, improving productivity and reducing conflicts.
- **Testing**: Each module can be independently tested, making it easier to identify and fix bugs. This enhances the reliability of the machine learning pipeline.

### Structure and Components of the Modular Approach

The structure of a modular machine learning project typically includes the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion Module**: This module handles the retrieval and loading of datasets, such as downloading data from MoneyPuck or other sources, and ensures that the data is in the right format for processing.

2. **Data Preprocessing Module**: This component includes functions for cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This can involve handling missing values, normalizing data, feature extraction, and more.

## 9. Hypothetical Gain from the model

This project created a predictive model for NHL games, analyzing the potential financial gains from betting based on predicted outcomes. The model achieves an accuracy of **71%**, enabling users to make informed betting decisions throughout an NHL season. Now let's see how it would work in real use case.

## Model Assumptions

- **Total Games in a Season**: Approximately **656 games**.
- **Predicted Wins**: With a **62%** accuracy:
  Predicted Wins = 0.62 * 656 ≈ 432 wins

## Hypothetical Betting Example

Let’s assume our model predicts the winning team for each game based on its analysis. We will consider a mix of different teams across hypothetical matchups throughout the season.

### Betting Strategy

- **Bet $100** on the predicted winning team in each matchup.

### Expected Winnings Calculation

1. **Winning Teams and Odds**: For simplicity, we assume the following moneyline odds for various hypothetical teams:
   - **Favorites (approx. 60% of predicted wins)**: Average odds of -120
   - **Underdogs (approx. 40% of predicted wins)**: Average odds of +150

#### Breakdown of Bets

- **Number of Bets on Favorites**:
  Bets on Favorites = 0.6 * 432 ≈ 259 wins

- **Number of Bets on Underdogs**:
  Bets on Underdogs = 0.4 * 432 ≈ 173 wins

- **Losses (Incorrect Predictions)**:
  Losses = 656 - 432 ≈ 224 losses

### Total Payout Calculation

1. **For Favorites (Odds -120)**:
   - **Profit Calculation**:
     Profit per Bet = 100 * (100 / 120) ≈ 83.33

   - **Total Profit**:
     Total Profit from Favorites = 259 * 83.33 ≈ 21,658.67

2. **For Underdogs (Odds +150)**:
   - **Profit Calculation**:
     Profit per Bet = 100 * (150 / 100) = 150

   - **Total Profit**:
     Total Profit from Underdogs = 173 * 150 = 25,950

3. **For Losses**:
   - **Total Loss**: Total Loss from Incorrect Predictions = 224 * 100 = 22,400

### Total Estimated Profit for the Season

Total Estimated Profit = 21,658.67 + 25,950 - 22,400 ≈ 25,208.67

The adjusted total estimated profit for an entire season of NHL hockey games amounts to **$25,208.67**. This figure indicates a positive return on investment, showcasing the potential profitability of employing a strategic betting approach based on model predictions.

The potential ROI for the betting strategy is approximately **40%** a season.
